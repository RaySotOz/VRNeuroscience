<h1>Neuroscience VR project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I develope this project for an interview for Campus Biotech. The purpose was to develop a VR experience for evaluating the stress in teenagers by using simple math problems that increases difficulty as the test progress. Since another requirement was to not make a violent game, I came up with the idea of implementing the experience as an escape room. For progressing through the room math problems have to be solved, as stated, they first start as simple problems and difficulty increases as the user go depper into the room. The user has a fix time to solve the problem, if the time runs out, the user has to start again. The VR was developed for Google Cardboard, this allow to anyone use this experience and that no expensive hardware is needed.Also, the models were low poly, so there was no problems in lag problems due to high graphics processing.
